									This project was my final presentation of my undergraduate GIS Methods class.  My objective was to analyze whether defoliation caused by invasive gypsy moth larvae occurs more frequently closer to recreation areas in Virginia forests.  This project idea was based on the fact that gypsy moth larvae and egg sacs can easily be transported long distances by cars and firewood, so I wanted to observe whether recreation areas where hotspots of activity as a result.
								</p>
								<p>
									I began with defoliation polygons from the Virginia Department of Forestry (2000-2009 data), which were recorded by aerial surveys*.  Recreation points (which included campgrounds and picnic areas) came from the U.S. Forest Service.  Land cover data came also came from VDOF, which I simplified into Forest, Non-Forest, and Water categories to suit my needs.  I placed random points in both foliated and defoliated areas, then calculated the distance between each of those points to the nearest recreation point.
								</p>
								<p>
									Random points in defoliated areas were, on average, closer to recreation points than random points in areas that had experienced no defoliation.  Thus, I concluded that there exists a possible correlation between defoliated areas and recreation points in Virginia forests.
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>*Of interest: I ended up participating in one of these gypsy moth aerial surveys during my internship with VDOF, much to my enjoyment.</i>
